# Better Barter System

This is an app I created to help match book buyers with book sellers. Users first enter the books they want
and the books they have, and the app then automatically checks every 30 minutes and notifies users 
if there are any possible trades. The BFS algorithm is used to determine the presence of trades, which
can involve up to three people.

The app uses Firebase's Cloud Firestore as the backend storage solution, and it even includes 
email templates for contacting the members of a trade. This app is in the process of being added
to the Google Play Store.
